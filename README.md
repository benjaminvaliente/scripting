### Python

To install Python, follow these steps:

- **Linux**: Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check the version using:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    If Python is not installed, you can install it using your package manager. 

    For example, on Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install -y python3
    ```

    For example, on CentOS:

    ```bash
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install -y python3
    ```

- **macOS**: macOS comes with Python 2.x pre-installed. However, it's recommended to install Python 3.x for compatibility. You can use Homebrew to install Python 3:

    ```bash
    brew install python3
    ```

- **Windows**: Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the installer for Windows. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
